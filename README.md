# face-detector

In the context of the Django web application, my prior experience was primarily centered around Streamlit and React.js frameworks (ML batch). Nevertheless, I endeavored to construct a basic user interface for the application. Despite numerous attempts and persistent troubleshooting, I encountered a perplexing issue with my facial detection model's failure to recognize uploaded videos on the backend. My subsequent effort involved the implementation of a simplified model, employing a straightforward bounding box approach for facial detection, which regrettably yielded unsatisfactory results.

Subsequently, I reached a point of frustration and decided to discontinue the development of the web user interface. Consequently, I am presently in the process of submitting my facial detection model for review. While I initially contemplated implementing a solution using React.js, constraints on time and a sense of demotivation ultimately led to this decision. I hope my honesty in detailing these challenges will contribute to a fair consideration of my submission.
